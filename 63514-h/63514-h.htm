<span class="i0">And found him a hat for his curly head<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And called to a dog somewhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then off like a flash down the shady lane<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With a whistle and cry and song;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His eyes all bright and his cheeks all red,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A friend of the birds and bees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then through the hedges and out of the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For naught in the world goes wrong<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He waved us a kiss with a little brown hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">And my dog he will eat with me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he swung his hat on its tangled string<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till the curly dog wagged his tail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And romped and played like a boy in spring<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And barked him a comrade’s hail.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And the years and the years go by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sometime he’ll come, as we’ve seen him do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With the bark of a dog and a song,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He smiled at me and then he rubbed some dust out of his eye,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A little girl up in his yard who used to smile just so;<br /></span>

<span class="ih">Venting his glee in a voiceless shout, as a blareless band, all still and dumb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down the length of the avenue, and a bugle corps blew a noteless blare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While a screechless rocket with noiseless hiss cut a fireless path through the silent air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blareless band played a soundless tune and the crackerless lad gave a voiceless shout<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the rippling folds of the unfurled flag from the upheld standard fluttered out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hurrah!” he cried with a voiceless cry, put forth from his lips in a speechless way.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A popless cracker fizzless died, and the band played a blareless tune once more;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lips of the village speaker moved in the tongueless strains of a wordless speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a graceless benediction fell, and the crackerless lad, in a voiceless way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave a soundless shout for Bunker Hill and the noiseless Independence Day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, the pulseless thrill of the noiseless guns and the tootless fifes and the headless drums,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heartless joy of the crackerless lad, as the soundless pageant noiseless comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the village street, and the sightless glow of the hissless rocket’s fireless glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With noiseless swish from the silent earth through the measureless breadth of the lightless air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a fingerless youth of the olden time, when crackers popped and cannons roared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked on the scene with much disgust and the look of a lad who is greatly bored;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried aloud&mdash;’twas the only sound that was heard, not made in a voiceless way:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He says we’re most too much for him and thinks he’ll hardly stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He just played drop-the-handkerchief and blind man’s buff, but he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Says, My! we’ve got him out of breath and tired as he can be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says it’s most too much for him to play leap-frog and ball,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He started to play hide and seek, and first he had to blind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he ran with all his might to see who he could find,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He only ran in under once when we were in the swing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He only got a few feet up he slid right down again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said he used to climb a tree, oh, very, very tall<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sometimes when he goes back home and holds us by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wringing wet and out of breath, our Ma says “Goodness, Land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think you are the youngest boy of all the boys in sight.”<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And sometimes in the parlor, why, he says he was so strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he was just a boy they used to take him right along<br /></span>
